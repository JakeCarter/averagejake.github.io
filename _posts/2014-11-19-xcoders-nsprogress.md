Here's video of an [Xcoders](http://www.meetup.com/xcoders/) talk I gave back in June about NSProgress. I made a mistake about calling:

```objc
-[NSProgress becomeCurrentWithPendingUnitCount:]
```

Listen through to the end. One of the attendees chimes in and helps me out during Q&A. Basically it can be used to group nested NSProgresses.
