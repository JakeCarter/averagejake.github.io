We're closing in on WWDC 2017 and I just realized I haven't written up my wishlist yet. Here it is, in no particular order. 

## API for Making Professional Apps

I work on professional productivity applications and a lot of times we end up creating a lot of infrastructure ourselves instead of using built in controls. Some of this is inevitable. The UIKit team can't possible plan for every apps use case, 

- Toolbar Overflow API
- View Based Toolbars
- Color picker?

### Toolbar Overflow API for iOS

iOS Apps are now expected to adapt from something as large as a 12.9" iPad Pro all the way down to the 4" display of an iPhone 5. Size Classes and Auto Layout only get us so far and since we don't actually provide UIToolbar with views — we usually provide a `UIBarButtonItem` without a `customView` — we have very little say so over the layout of the toolbar. I'm totally fine without control as long as the thing taking over control does The Right Thing™. Currently if you have too many items to fit into the toolbar or navigation bar, the extras silently fall off. `NSToolbar` on macOS handles this by adding an 'overflow' button that, when clicked, will display the overflow items. I would love something similar for `UIToolbar`/`UINavigationBar`.


Something that helps devs sell more iOS software.
