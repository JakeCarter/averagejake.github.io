		<p>I started this blog to make myself formalize the ideas knocking around in my head, but not posting anything isn’t going to help. So, I’ve decided that I’m going to force myself to post something at least once a week. I’ve also decided to make it very easy on myself by not defining what ‘something’ is. It could be one sentence about how I feel about something or it could be a video post explaining a complex topic. Either way, I need to start formalizing my thoughts and ideas. Its probably going to suck for awhile but hopefully, over time, I’ll get better at this. Feel free to hold me accountable and nag me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jakecarter">Twitter (@jakecarter)</a>.</p>

<p>PS. This totally counts for this week’s post.</p>
