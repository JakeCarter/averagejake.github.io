		<p>I’ve already written about <a href="http://averagejake.com/post/104146203887/uisplitviewcontroller-adaptability-part-1">Adaptability</a> a bit, but iOS 8.3 was released today and with it we got a few new additions.</p>

<h2 id="adaptability-prior-to-ios-83">Adaptability Prior to iOS 8.3</h2>
<p>Before iOS 8.3, Adaptability was a way to adapt a modal style presentation (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-[UIViewController presentViewController:animated:]</code>) from it’s original style to something new when the horizontal size class changed from <em>Regular</em> to <em>Compact</em>. For example, lets say I create a view controller and set its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalPresentationStyle = .Popover</code>. On iPad — which always has a Regular-Regular<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> size classe — the view controller would appear in a popover, just like you’d expect. If it were presented on an iPhone 6 Plus in landscape — which has a Regular-Compact environment — we would also get a popover presentation. If we then rotated that iPhone 6 Plus into portrait — Compact-Regular — the popover presentation would <em>adapt</em> into a full screen<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> presentation.</p>

<p>What this means is that the system defines Any-Compact as irregular and causes that type of presentation to take on its adaptive presentation style. The documentation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-[UIPresentationController adaptivePresentationStyle]</code> even states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Returns the presentation style to use when the presented view controller becomes <strong>horizontally compact</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="new-in-ios-83">New in iOS 8.3</h2>
<p>iOS 8.3 thinks about Adaptability a little differently, and it’s something to take note of. Adaptability is no longer focused <strong>solely</strong> on the horizontal size class. Under iOS 8.3, UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate gained two new methods, but we’re going to focus on this one:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- (UIModalPresentationStyle)adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationController:(UIPresentationController *)controller traitCollection:(UITraitCollection *)traitCollection;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the addition of the UITraitCollection argument. This now means that we can decide what size class combinations deserve an adaptive style.</p>

<h2 id="ios-83-popover-gotcha">iOS 8.3 Popover Gotcha</h2>
<p>I chose the Popover example earlier for a reason. When you start building your apps against the iOS 8.3 SDK you’ll notice that Popovers now display as FormSheets on iPhone 6 Plus in landscape. This took me by surprise. Finally I noticed the new API and adjusted my code according. What I figured out was that by default, UIPopoverPresentationController now chooses an adaptive style of FormSheet for a Regular-Compact environment.  I’m very happy that we have public API to account for this new change, but I still feel like it was an odd change to make in a point release.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-adaptability">The Future of Adaptability</h2>
<p>With this new API, Adaptability no longer means horizontally compact. I think Apple’s new definition is <em>not Regular</em> in either axis. If one of the size classes is not Regular, the presentation needs to be adapted. Currently we only have two<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> size classes — Compact and Regular — but Apple could introduce more<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> in the future. For now we can think about Any-Compact or Compact-Any as adaptive sizes, but I have a feeling we should internalize Any-!Regular and !Regular-Any as adaptive. Put another way, in the future, being Adaptable may not only mean accounting for a smaller trait collections; It may also mean accounting for larger ones.</p>

      <p>When talking about size classes I use the shorthand <em>X-Y</em> where X is the horizontal size class and Y is the vertical size class. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Full screen is just the default. There are several ways to change this. (UIPresentationController’s adaptivePresentationStyle property and UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate’s various methods.) <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
