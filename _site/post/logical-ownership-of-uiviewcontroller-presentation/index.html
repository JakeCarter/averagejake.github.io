		<p>Prior to iOS 8, view controller presentation worked like so:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">ViewControllerA</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIViewController</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
	<span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">presentTheThing</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
		<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">theThing</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">ViewControllerB</span><span class="p">()</span>
		<span class="n">theThing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">modalPresentationStyle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">SomeStyle</span>
		<span class="k">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">presentViewController</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">theThing</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">animated</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">completion</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s my problem with this. Who’s job is it to make sure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">theThing</code> is dismissible? Traditionally, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalPresentationStyle</code> required a dismiss button (basically any presentation style other than popover requires a way to dismiss the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentedViewController</code>), it was up to the presenting view controller to shove the view controller to be presented into a UINavigationController so that a dismiss button could be added to the top bar. This works fine when your presenting content view controllers, but quickly falls down in other situations. What if the view controller to be presented was already a UINavigationController? Or what if the view controller to be presented was a custom container. Who is responsible then for making sure the dismiss button is actually there? Before today, I would have argued that to comply with <strong>Encapsulation</strong> (one of the major pillars of OO design) the view controller being presented should know how to style itself for any presentation. The alternative would be that the view controller doing the presenting would have to know <em>way too much</em> about the view controller it’s about present. With that mindset, the custom container (which has it’s own navigation bar, by the way) should know when it should add a dismiss button to its navigation bar and when it shouldn’t depending on how it’s currently being presented. Unfortunately, there really isn’t any API to figure that out.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to iOS 8 for now…</p>

<p>With iOS 8 Apple added UIPresentationController into the mix. No longer are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentingViewController</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentedViewController</code> the only ones involved in presentation. Now, the view controller to be presented will vend a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">popoverPresentationController</code> as appropriate) so that the presentation can participate in adaptability. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController</code> also allows a delegate to tweak how adaptability is handled. The two delegate callbacks that we care about for this discussion are:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Allows the delegate to change the presentation style from its default adaptive alternitive</span>
<span class="nf">adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationController</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">controller</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIPresentationController</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">UIModalPresentationStyle</span>

<span class="c1">// Allows the delegate to change the view controller hierarchy for a given adaptive presentation style, usually this means shoving the presentedViewController into a UINavigationController</span>
<span class="nf">presentationController</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">controller</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIPresentationController</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle</span> <span class="nv">style</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIModalPresentationStyle</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">UIViewController</span><span class="p">?</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, back to my custom container, still in the <strong>Encapsulation</strong> mindset…</p>

<p>My initial thought was that my custom container could become the delegate of its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController</code> and when it got the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController(_,viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle:)</code> call, instead of wrapping it up, just add or remove its own dismiss button from its own navigation bar. This fits in with encapsulation, but feels <em>very</em> weird from a Cocoa design stand point. For one, when should <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerB</code> assign itself as its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController.delegate</code>?</p>

<p>Slight tangent…
The default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalPresentationStyle</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.FullScreen</code>. If you ask a view controller for its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController</code> before you set its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalPresentationStyle</code> you will get a full screen presentation controller. If you then set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalPresentationStyle</code> to something other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.FullScreen</code> and ask for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController</code> again, you’ll get back the same full screen presentation controller. Still need to file this one, but I’ve seen other presentation controller weirdness so I bet this gets closed “Works as intended.”</p>

<p>So, back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerB</code> grabbing its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController.delegate</code>… It needs to wait until its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalPresentationStyle</code> has been set. So it could override the setter (or add a property observer in Swift) and do that then, but what if someone else grabs it later. It is a common design pattern, during the whole presentation dance, that the view controller doing the presenting will set itself as the delegate of the view controller to be presented if it wants to be. (Think about presenting a UIImagePickerController.) So it might also make sense that it should do the same with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController.delegate</code> of the view controller to be presented. Now I would need some way to guarantee that anytime <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerB</code> is presented, that it is its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController.delegate</code>.</p>

<p>One of the most important things I’ve learned over the years about Cocoa/CocoaTouch development… If it feels like you’re fighting the frameworks, you’re probably doing it wrong.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerA</code> is setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerB</code> up for presentation. There is currently no API for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentedViewController</code> to know how it is currently being presented. Now that adaptability has been introduced, you could set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.Popover</code> but actually be in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.FullScreen</code> presentation, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentedViewController</code> has no clear way to find that out. There is, however, API for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController</code> to notify its delegate about adaptability. And we already have a design pattern that sets president for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerA</code> to become the delegate of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerB.presentationController</code>.</p>

<p>So… “Button, button, who’s got the button?”</p>

<p>My answer, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerA</code> logically owns the presentation and it should subscribe as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController.delegate</code>. If it’s presenting a content view controller, it should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">presentationController(_,viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle:)</code> to wrap that content view controller in a UINavigationController when appropriate and it should push some logic down to any custom containers letting them know they are now being adapted. Yes, that still means that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerA</code> needs to know <em>way too much</em> about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewControllerB</code> but really, it’s in the perfect position to do so.</p>
